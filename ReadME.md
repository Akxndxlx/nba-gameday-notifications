Grant Role permissions 

Set Up IAM Roles and Policies
Create an IAM Role for your Lambda function with the necessary permissions:
- Amazon EventBridge Permissions to trigger the Lambda function.
- Amazon SNS Permissions to publish messages to an SNS topic.

Attach policies such as AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and AmazonSNSFullAccess to the role.

Create an Amazon SNS Topic
- Go to the SNS Console and create a new topic (e.g., data-publisher-topic).
- Note the topic ARN for later use.
- Optionally, add subscriptions (email, SMS, or other endpoints) to the topic.

Set Up a Lambda Function
- Create a Lambda function in the Lambda Console.
- Write code in the language of your choice (Python, Node.js, etc.) to process incoming data and publish it to the SNS topic:
import boto3
import json


Create an Amazon EventBridge Rule
- Go to the EventBridge Console and create a new rule to trigger the Lambda function:
- Specify an event source (e.g., a scheduled event or an AWS service event like S3 upload).
- Set the target to the Lambda function.
- Test the Setup

Manually invoke the EventBridge rule or wait for the scheduled/triggered event.

Verify that the Lambda function processes the event and publishes a message to the SNS topic.

Check your subscription (email, SMS, etc.) to confirm message delivery.
